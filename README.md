Annuity
=======

Annuity Calculator written in Clojure with a Swing UI, Charts, Excel and PDF
Exports.

While being a fully functional application (with at least the functionality
than the guy in the bank had in his application), it is also a show case and
example of using some of the Clojure libraries I've written.

The Annuity application uses these libraries:
* [clj.base](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljBase/tree/master/clj.base)
* [clj.java](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljBase/tree/master/clj.java)
* [math.base](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljMath)
* [math.financial](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljMath)
* [cmp.batik](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljComponents/tree/master/cmp.batik)
* [cmp.fop](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljComponents/tree/master/cmp.fop)
* [cmp.jfreechart](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljComponents/tree/master/cmp.jfreechart)
* [cmp.poi](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljComponents/tree/master/cmp.poi)
* [xml.core](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljXML/tree/master/xml.core)
* [xml.dsl](https://github.com/lsolbach/CljXML/tree/master/xml.dsl)
