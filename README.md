Annuity
=======

Annuity Calculator written in Clojure with a Swing UI, Charts, Excel and PDF
Exports.

While being a fully functional application (with at least the functionality
than the guy in the bank had in his application), it is also a show case and
example of using some of the Clojure libraries I've written.

The Annuity application uses these libraries:
* [clj.base](https://github.com/soulspace-org/clj.base)
* [clj.java](https://github.com/soulspace-org/clj.java)
* [clj.swing](https://github.com/soulspace-org/clj.swing)
* [math.core](https://github.com/soulspace-org/math.core)
* [math.financial](https://github.com/soulspace-org/math.financial)
* [cmp.batik](https://github.com/soulspace-org/cmp.batik)
* [cmp.fop](https://github.com/soulspace-org/cmp.fop)
* [cmp.jfreechart](https://github.com/soulspace-org/cmp.jfreechart)
* [cmp.poi](https://github.com/soulspace-org/cmp.poi)
* [xml.dsl](https://github.com/soulspace-org/xml.dsl)
